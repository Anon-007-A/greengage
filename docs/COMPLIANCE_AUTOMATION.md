## 1. CSRD Double Materiality Automation

### What is Double Materiality?

**Double Materiality = Financial Materiality + Impact Materiality**

- **Financial Materiality:** What ESG issues affect the bank's financial performance?

```
Per analyst per year:
├─ CSRD reporting: 40 hours
├─ TCFD reporting: 30 hours
├─ EU Taxonomy: 40 hours
├─ Green Bond prep: 20 hours
└─ Total: 130 hours/year

Cost: 130 hours × €75/hour = €9,750 wasted annually per analyst
Compliance Team (10 analysts): 1,300 hours = €97,500 wasted annually
```

**With GreenGauge (€5K/month):**

```
Per analyst per year:
├─ CSRD reporting: 5 minutes (vs 40 hours) = 39.92 hours saved
