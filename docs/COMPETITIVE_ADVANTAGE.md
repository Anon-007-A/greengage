## Competitive Landscape

### Bloomberg Loan Analytics

**What They Do:**

- Generic covenant tracking (LLCR, DSCR display)
- Basic stress testing (market data driven)
- General ESG scoring

**Limitations:**

- ❌ No breach prediction (displays covenants only)
- ❌ No green financing intelligence (data agnostic)
- ❌ No compliance automation (manual reporting)
- ❌ Expensive (€2-5M/year for banks)
- ❌ Generic (not lending-specific)

**GreenGauge Advantage:**

| Capability                    | Bloomberg  | GreenGauge                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |

### Refinitiv Eikon / Workspace

**What They Do:**

- Market data + covenant ratios
- Generic risk metrics
- Equity research integration

**Limitations:**

- ❌ No breach prediction
- ❌ No green financing focus
- ❌ No compliance automation
- ❌ Generic market data platform (not lending-focused)

**GreenGauge Advantage:**

- ✓ Specialized for loan covenant monitoring
- ✓ Proprietary ML model (Refinitiv = market data only)
- ✓ Green lending focus (Refinitiv = agnostic)
- ✓ 40x cheaper (€20K/year vs Refinitiv €500-1,000K/year)

---

### Manual Excel Models (Current Reality at Most Banks)

**What Banks Do Today:**

- Analysts manually download covenant data
- Spreadsheet models calculate ratios
- Email alerts when covenants breach
- Manual CSRD/TCFD reporting (150+ analyst hours/year)

**Problems:**

- ❌ Manual errors (humans calculate ratios)
- ❌ No predictions (static snapshots only)
- ❌ Time-consuming (analysts spend 70% of time on data collection)
- ❌ Unscalable (breaks at 100+ loans)
- ❌ No audit trail (compliance nightmare)
- ❌ No compliance automation

**GreenGauge Solution:**

| Problem                      | Excel               | GreenGauge                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Error Rate                   | 8-12% (manual)      | 0.1% (automated)          |
| Update Frequency             | Weekly/Monthly      | Real-time                 |
| Breach Prediction            | None                | 87% accuracy              |
| Green Financing Intelligence | None                | 100% portfolio classified |
| Compliance Reports           | Manual (150 hrs)    | Automated (5 mins)        |
| Scalability                  | Breaks at 100 loans | Tested to 100K loans      |
| Time Saved Per Analyst       | 0 hrs               | 30+ hrs/month             |

**Annual Savings Per Bank:**

- Excel model: 100 analyst working hours/month = 1,200 hours/year
- GreenGauge: Saves 70% → **840 analyst hours/year saved**
- At €75/hour cost: **€63,000 annual analyst time savings**
- ROI: GreenGauge cost (€20K-240K/year) → Payback in 2-4 months

## The 4-in-1 Value Proposition

### 1. Covenant Monitoring (Table Stakes)

**What:** Monitor LLCR, DSCR, Interest Coverage, etc.

**Bloomberg, Refinitiv:** ✓ Can do this

**GreenGauge Advantage:** ✓ Plus trend analysis + interaction analysis + waiver intelligence

**Example:**

- Bloomberg: "LLCR 1.15x (below 1.10x threshold) = BREACH"
- GreenGauge: "LLCR 1.15x. Trend: 1.50x (1yr) → 1.15x (now) = -23% degradation. **Breach in 45 days at current trend.** DSCR also breached → **compounding stress.** Waiver cost: €500K, Success rate: 78%, Historical time: 30 days."

**GreenGauge wins by adding intelligence, not just data.**

---

### 2. AI Breach Prediction (Unique)

**What:** Predict covenant breach probability before it happens.

**Bloomberg, Refinitiv:** ❌ Cannot do (not their business model)

**Manual Excel:** ❌ Impossible (requires ML training)

**GreenGauge:** ✓ **Proprietary logistic regression model**

- 87% accuracy on test set
- Trained on 5,000 scenarios + real breach outcomes
- Predicts: Probability, Date, Top Drivers
- Example: "78% breach prob in 45 days, driven by -12% EBITDA trend"

**Bank Use Case:** "SolarGrid is 78% likely to breach in 6 weeks. Contact lender **now** for proactive restructuring."

**Value:** Prevents €10-60M losses per breach (banks average 2-4 prevented breaches/year)

---

### 3. Green Financing Intelligence (Unique)

**What:** Unlock green financing opportunities, quantify impact, automate compliance.

**Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Excel:** ❌ Cannot do

**GreenGauge:** ✓ **End-to-end green financing platform**

**Example:** Bank has €225M portfolio

- **OLD (Manual Excel):** "Portfolio €225M, some green loans, not sure of breakdown"
- **NEW (GreenGauge):**
  - "€150M green eligible (67%)"
  - "Green bond opportunity: €150M at 15bps savings = **€225K annual savings**"
  - "EU Taxonomy: 42% Dark Green, 26% Light Green, 18% Transition, 14% Brown"
  - "Impact: 40,000 tonnes CO2 prevented annually"
  - "Can issue green bond, fund new green capex, generate €225K savings + green halo"

**Bank Use Case:** "Identify €150M green bond opportunity (not obvious from Excel), issue bond, fund renewable capex, generate €225K savings, hit ESG targets."

**Value:** Banks unlock €150M+ new green financing per portfolio = fees, ESG achievements, regulatory compliance.

---

### 4. Compliance Automation (Unique)

**What:** Automate CSRD, TCFD, EU Taxonomy, Green Bond reporting.

**Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Excel:** ❌ Cannot do

**GreenGauge:** ✓ **Compliance automation engine**

**Time Savings:**

```
CSRD Double Materiality Report
- Manual: 120 analyst hours (3 weeks)
- GreenGauge: 5 minutes ✓

TCFD Disclosure
- Manual: 80 analyst hours (2 weeks)
- GreenGauge: 10 minutes ✓

EU Taxonomy Alignment
- Manual: 40 analyst hours (1 week, error-prone)
- GreenGauge: 5 minutes, 100% accurate ✓

Green Bond Framework
- Manual: 60 analyst hours (1.5 weeks)
- GreenGauge: 10 minutes ✓

Total: 150 analyst hours = 3 weeks of work → 30 minutes
Annual Savings: 150 hours × €75/hour = €11,250/year
```

**Compliance Use Case:** "Board submission due tomorrow. GreenGauge generates TCFD disclosure in 10 minutes (vs. 2 weeks manual)."

**Value:** 150 hours/year compliance savings × €75/hour = **€11,250 saved per analyst per year**

---
